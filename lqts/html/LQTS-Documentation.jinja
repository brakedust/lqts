  <h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
  <p>LQTS (pronounced Locutus) is a <em>L</em>ightweight job <em>Q</em>ueueing <em>S</em>ystem. Its purpose is to manage
    the execution of a large number of computational jobs, only exeucuting a fixed amount of them concurrently. LQTS is
    intended to be very easy to run. There is no setup required, but some options may be controlled through environment
    variables or a .env file.</p>
  <p>If you are familiar with PBS queueing system on Linux, this should be very familiar.</p>
  <p>The major concepts involved in this are:</p>
  <pre><code>* Job Queue - a list of jobs to be executed
* Job Submission - putting a job in the queue
* Job Server - the process that gets submissions, manages the queue,
  and executes the jobs
* Worker - a child process of the server that executes the job</code></pre>
  <h1 id="installation">2. Installation</h1>
  <p>The recommended installation method for LQTS is to use the python tool <strong>pipx</strong>. <strong>pipx</strong>
    will install a Python application into a unique, isolated virtual enviornment in the folder
    <em>c:&lt;username&gt;.local. Any commands that are defined in the Python package will have a command file placed in
    </em>c:&lt;username&gt;.local. Adding the pipx bin directory to your PATH environment variable is then all that’s
    require to make the application generally available.
  </p>
  <p>I typically install pipx into my root python installtion. This can be done like this:</p>
  <pre><code>$ python -m pip install pipx</code></pre>
  <p>LQTS can then be installed as follows:</p>
  <pre><code>$ pipx install lqts-1.0.54-py3-none-any.whl</code></pre>
  <p>Once the <strong>pipx</strong> bin directory is added to your system PATH, you can run <strong>qstart</strong> to
    start up the server.</p>
  <h1 id="starting-the-job-server">3. Starting the Job Server</h1>
  <p>LQST is a client/server app. The server runs on localhost (IP address is 127.0.0.1) and port 9200. The server has
    process pool and a queue that it uses to manage jobs that are submitted to it. The server is started using the
    qstart.exe program.</p>
  <pre><code>$ qstart.exe</code></pre>
  <p>On start up the server should display</p>
  <pre><code>Starting up LoQuTuS server - 1.0.8+5bc479c
Worker pool started with 32 workers
Visit http://127.0.0.1:9200/qstatus to view the queue status</code></pre>
  <p>By default there are (# CPUs - 2) workers avaialable. This can be queried by calling <code>qworkers.exe</code> with
    no arguments. The number of workers can be dynamically adjusted by calling <code>qworkers.exe</code> with one
    argument that is the number of workers desired.</p>
  <h1 id="server-configuration">4. Server Configuration</h1>
  <p>Ther server has several settings that can be adjusted by setting environment variables or by starting the server in
    a directory where a file name <code>.env</code> is present. Unless you have a specific requirement, it is not
    recommended to change these from their defaults. The available settings are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>LQTS_PORT - The port the server is bound to (change if you want to run mulitple instances)</li>
    <li>LQTS_NWORKERS - Maximum number of workers/concurrent jobs</li>
    <li>LQTS_COMPLETED_LIMIT - Number of completed jobs the server “remembers” (i.e. that would show up in qstat)</li>
    <li>LQTS_RESUME_ON_START_UP - Whether or not to attempt to resume the job queue based on the contents of the
      LQTS_QUEUE_FILE (It is recommended not to set this to true currently, as it can be flakey.)</li>
    <li>LQTS_QUEUE_FILE – location of the file where LQTS writes its current queue every few minutes</li>
  </ul>
  <h1 id="job-submission">5. Job Submission</h1>
  <p>Several commands are available for different use cases to submit jobs to the queue. Each qsub command returns the
    job ID for the submitted job(s).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>qsub - submit one job</li>
    <li>qsub-multi - submit multiple commands to the queue</li>
    <li>qsub-cmulti - submit mutliple jobs to the queue, where the command is the same but the input files are different
    </li>
    <li>qsub-argfile - submit mutliple jobs to the queue, where each job is defined by a line if the given file</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="job-groups">Job Groups</h2>
  <p>Qsub commands that submit multiple jobs at once create a job group with job IDs that look like 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, … In
    most cases referencing a job ID of “3” will refer to the whole job group. For example <code>qdel 3</code> will
    remove the entire job group for the queue and stop any currently executing jobs in the job group.</p>
  <h2 id="qsub">qsub</h2>
  <p>The <code>qsub</code> command submits one job to the queue.</p>
  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre><code>$ qsub myprogram.exe --log -- --MyOption1 --MyOption2</code></pre>
  <p>In the above example –MyOption1 and –MyOption2 would be pass along to myprogram.exe when it executes. Any
    parameters after “–” get passed along in this way.</p>

  <h2 id="qsub-argfile">qsub-argfile</h2>
  <p>The <code>qsub-argfile</code> command submits mutliple jobs. For this command you need one executable file and a
    text file. Each line in the text file is represents a different job and has the arguments that will be passed to
    your executable command.</p>
  <p>For example, imagine you have a script <code>echoit.bat</code> and its contents are</p>
  <pre><code>echo $1
sleep 2</code></pre>
  <p>Also there is an <code>argfile.txt</code> file:</p>
  <pre><code>jim
dwight
pam
MICHAEL_SCOTT</code></pre>
  <p>Here you want to pass each line separately <code>echoit.bat</code></p>
  <pre><code>$ qsub-argfile echoit.bat argfile.txt --log</code></pre>
  <p>Specifying <code>--log</code> will case LQTS to write a log file for each job. The log file contains any output
    that would have been written to the screen as well as some job performance information.</p>

  <h1 id="passing-additional-arguments-to-your-command">6. Passing Additional Arguments to your Command</h1>
  <p>After the command and input file/arg file, arguments are typically interpreted as being arguments passed to the
    qsub command itself and are not passed on to your program. Like many Linux commands, specifying a double dash “–”
    will allow you to specify additional arguments you want passed to your command.</p>
  <pre><code>$ qsub myprogram.exe --log -- --flagForMyProgram true</code></pre>
  <p>Here “<code>--log</code>” is consumed by the qsub command and “<code>--flagForMyProgram true</code>” is passed
    along to myprogram.exe when it is executed.</p>
  <h1 id="waiting-for-a-job-to-complete">7. Waiting for a job to complete</h1>
  <p>The <code>qwait.exe</code> command will block until the specified jobs have completed. If you have something you
    want to happen once a set of jobs has completed, use this. You can specifies the job IDs as arguments to
    <code>qwait</code>, or it will read them from stdin. This means you can pipe the output of the <code>qsub</code>
    commands directly into <code>qwait</code>.
  </p>
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <pre><code>$ qsub myprogram.exe --log -- --flagForMyProgram true
10
$ qwait 10</code></pre>
  <p>Alternatively:</p>
  <pre><code>$ qsub myprogram.exe --log -- --flagForMyProgram true | qwait</code></pre>
  <h1 id="job-priority">8. Job Priority</h1>
  <p>Each job has a priortity associated with it. Jobs with higher priority are executed before jobs with lower
    priority. Most <code>qsub</code> commands support a <code>--priority</code> argument. There is also the
    <code>qpriority</code> command that allows you to change the priority of a job after it has been submitted.
  </p>
  <pre><code>Usage: qpriority [OPTIONS] PRIORITY [JOB_IDS]...

  Change the priority of one or more jobs

Options:
  --port INTEGER     The port number of the server  [default: 9200]
  --ip_address TEXT  The IP address of the server  [default: 127.0.0.1]
  --help             Show this message and exit.</code></pre>
  <h1 id="deleting-a-job">9. Deleting a Job</h1>
  <p>Use the <code>qdel</code> command to delete a job.</p>
  <h1 id="job-status-and-summary">10. Job Status and Summary</h1>
  <p>The <code>qstat</code> and <code>qsummary</code> commands provide information about the state of jobs in the queue.
    <code>qstat</code> provides information about each job and <code>qsummary</code> simply tells you how many jobs are
    running and how many are queued.
  </p>
  <p>You can also navigate to http://127.0.0.1:9200 (where 9200 is the port you have LQTS running on) to see an HTML
    table of the current status. This page auto-refreshes every two minutes.</p>
  <h1 id="testing-your-setup">11. Testing your setup</h1>
  <p><code>qsub-test</code> provides an easy way to test that LQTS is functioning properly. It writes a script that
    sleeps for a user defined amount of time and an argfile with a user defined number of jobs.</p>
  <p>The following example will write a script that sleeps for 5 seconds and submit 30 jobs to the queue.</p>
  <pre><code>$ qsub-test 5 --count 30</code></pre>
